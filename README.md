# SNAKES V 2.0
 CLI based Python game of snake.
 
 Hi Everyone. I don't know how to write a good readme file yet. But I am still learning to do new things.
 
 This is a ClI based game that sort of works on both linux shell and Windows Command Prompt. It is not that much good but I am making it better. This was a simple project I used to learn new things in python. I belive writing new projects in language is a far faster way of learning the language than writing simple hello world programs and fibonacci series. No offense but I know datastructures and algorithms are very much required. But blatantly wirting 100 year old scripts to print just those numbers kind of is boring. So that is why this code is here. I am kind of making these in the second part. There was a first part of it. It is kind of not so good. So I didnt upload it.

 ## Requirements
 I am using Python 3.x. I tried using it until 3.5.x and didn't find any issues at all.
 I recommend using a __command prompt__ or __linux bash shell__ (kind of) and not the __powershell__ because it doesnt have the same window size modification commands as I thought.
 
 ## Dependancies
 Well that was kind of the point of this adventure. No extra libraries. Although I used libraries , I didn't adda anything new than from a fresh install. But I will list all of the libraries used just for reference.
 - > __os__
 - > __sys__
 - > __time__
 - > __random__
 - > __msvcrt__
 
 ## Support Me ?
 This title may look ridiculus but I need knowledge support, not monetary (not yet :wink:). So if you find a better way to implement certain thing please do share.
 
 
 ### Enjoy the game :+1:
